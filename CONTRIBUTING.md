# How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to make AMP better!  The [amphtml CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) contains information on how to contribute that applies to most ampproject repositories, though some repositories may have some differences as specified in their CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Creating new repositories

The process of creating a new repository in the ampproject org is:

- File an issue in the meta reposotiry describing the purpose of the repository, the desired name and the desired initial set of admins.
- Notify the TSC of the request by ccing @ampproject/tsc
- Obtain approval from 3 members of [wg-approvers](https://github.com/orgs/ampproject/teams/wg-approvers).
- cc or assign the issue to @mrjoro to create the repository
