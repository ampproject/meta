This is the repository for information about the AMP Project.

The main code for the AMP Project lives in the [amphtml repo](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml).

AMP's [governance model](GOVERNANCE.md) defines how decisions about AMP's product and technical direction are made and how day-to-day work gets done.  The governance structures include:
* the [Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-tsc)
* the [Advisory Committee (AC)](https://github.com/ampproject/meta-ac)
* [Working Groups](https://github.com/ampproject/meta/tree/master/working-groups)
