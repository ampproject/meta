Each Working Group provides an update on their progress and priorities roughly once every three months at an AMP Design Review.  These updates are in addition to the detailed [bi-weekly status updates](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aampproject+label%3A%22Type%3A+Status+Update%22&type=Issues).

The following table shows the tentative schedule for updates:
