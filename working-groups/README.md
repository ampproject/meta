# Working Groups


An AMP [Working Group](https://github.com/ampproject/meta/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#working-groups) is a segment of the community with knowledge/interest in specific area of AMP. Working Groups are created by AMP’s [Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/ampproject/meta/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#technical-steering-committee-tsc).

Most Working Groups provide [~bi-weekly status updates](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aampproject+label%3A%22Type%3A+Status+Update%22&type=Issues).
